== Display sensor on/off ==
When using the BraillePen24, users accustomed to the regular piezoelectric Braille cells may notice that while they keep their fingers on top of them, the text displayed (in Braille) has some errors. The dots cannot be touched while their contents change because this effect may occur. The type of Braille dots used in the BraillePen24 allows for remarkably slim housing and good Braille quality, but the above-described effect is a drawback. BraillePen24 has a unique mechanism to compensate for this problem: a set of sensors underneath the Braille display. The sensors recognize the presence of your fingers on the display, and whenever the finger is raised or moved left/right, the text refreshes in that sector.
This way - when in doubt, it is enough to raise your finger above a cell to get a correction.
There may be two reasons to switch this feature off: for users that don't keep their fingers on the display all the time, this feature can be set off. Besides refreshing always while the user moves his fingers above the Braille cells consumes some power.
To change the state of the Display sensor feature - please enter the submenu and choose on or off.  An 8-dot sign marks the selected item.

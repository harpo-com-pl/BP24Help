Introduction for Application Mode Menu
The BraillePen24 Menu is activated when you Enter application mode (the Terminal/Application switch must be set to Right).
While in the menu, navigate with the joystick or Previous / Next (the outer) thumb keys. The Up and Down joystick movements or Previous and Next thumb keys (plus some alternative key shortcuts) move on the menu items available. To Enter the selected menu item, you need to use the joystick Down, or Space key + dot4 shortcut, or Enter (dot8); yet another way to choose an item is to touch any cursor routing key above the menu item. To exit a menu level, use the joystick Up, or Space key + dot1 shortcut (Space-a). First-letter navigation is available in the main menu: pressing the first letter of the item you are looking for in long menus is a quick way to jump to that item. This makes for a highly efficient experience. In large menus or long lists, first-letter navigation is handy. We will introduce this feature in the future versions of BraillePen24 that will be available to you by an easy firmware update.

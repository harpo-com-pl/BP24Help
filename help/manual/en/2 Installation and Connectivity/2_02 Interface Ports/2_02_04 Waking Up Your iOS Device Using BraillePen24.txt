== Waking Up Your iOS Device Using BraillePen24 ==
When using your BraillePen24, you may wake up your iOS device and initiate a connection between the BraillePen24 without touching the iPhone or iPad. Starting with iOS17, this feature is available when the paired Braille device is a HID type. Since BraillePen24 is such, you can benefit from the feature at once - whenever you turn your  BraillePen24 on, the paired iOS17 or newer device will turn on, too.
An iOS or Android phone may be used as an internet connectivity bridge for mobile data exchange. To use internal BraillePen24 applications, you need the BraillePen24 to be connected to the BraillePenSync app (see “Synchronizing the BraillePen24 data” section below). The devices maintain this connection even if turned off, so you only need to establish it once.

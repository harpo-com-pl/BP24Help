== Timer ==
This is a counter good for boiling eggs or similar tasks that require a set time period to be performed. Time is counted down from the set value to zero. Set the time by pressing dot8 (Enter) while on the timer display and entering the time in lowered notation (dot2 = 1, dot23 = 2, dot25 = 3, etc.). When you are done with one value, move with the thumb keys to the next (the Next thumb key) or the previous (the Previous thumb key). Dot78 under the edited value on display will help to orientate while setting the time.
Finish by pressing Space key + dot15 (Space-e).
To start the countdown press Space. When the time set elapses, you will hear a timer signal or feel the vibration, depending on the setting in Settings - Vibration and Sound. You will be informed by a message on the Braille display. This message and signal will show even if you are in some other function of the device (in Terminal mode as well). Any key cancels the message.
If while the timer works (a countdown is performed) you may cancel the process by entering the Time and Date - Timer menu and pressing Space key + dot14 (Space-c).

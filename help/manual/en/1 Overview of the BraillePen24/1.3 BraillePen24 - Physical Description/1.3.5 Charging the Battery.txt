IMPORTANT: Please fully charge your BraillePen24 before first use. You must charge the device for at least 8 hours before first use. After first use, it will take up to five hours to charge the battery fully (depending on the charger unit you will use, it may take longer with low-output chargers).
The BraillePen24 has a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery. Connect the BraillePen24 via USB-C to your PC or a power outlet using a USB-C adapter to charge the battery. The word “charging” will appear on the braille display when the BraillePen24
is connected to power and turned off. You can use the BraillePen24 while charging. You can view the battery status by using Two space keys + dot1234 (Spaces-p). 
Once fully charged, the BraillePen24 will display “battery full” and is ready for up to 20 hours of continuous operation on Bluetooth.
You can use any universal USB adapter to charge the BraillePen24. Just insert the USB cable’s connector into the adaptor’s USB port, insert the other connector into
the USB-C port on the rear side of your device, then plug the adapter into an AC outlet.
The BraillePen24’s battery management system includes a battery protection circuitry that
prevents it from being damaged by total discharge. If the battery is low, the BraillePen24
will warn you with a beeping sound before switching it off automatically.
Never try to replace the battery yourself. This will likely damage the device and void the warranty.
If your device needs repair, don't hesitate to contact your local dealer or the producer at support@harpo.com.pl for help.

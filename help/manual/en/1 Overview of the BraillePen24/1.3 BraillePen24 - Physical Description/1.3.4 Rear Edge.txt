Power Button
The power button is located on the rear edge of the right side of the device. To turn the device on or off, hold this button for approximately 3 seconds. The BraillePen24 will confirm with a beeping sound that it is powering on or off. The word “starting...” will appear on the braille display during the boot process.
The power button is also used to reset the BraillePen24 (when pressed and held for
approximately 10 seconds). This feature is helpful in case of a rare occurrence of a glitch in the device's software or if the user gets lost while navigating through the data.

Application/Terminal Mode Switch
At the rear edge, left to the power button, is an App/Terminal Switch. Slide it to your left to use the device with any screen reader (mobile or PC). Slide it to your right (closer to the power button) to use the applications included in your BraillePen24. 

Silence switch
In the middle of the rear edge is the Silence Switch, which suppresses all beeping sounds coming from the device when turned left. Regular operation with sounds when the Silence Switch is turned right. When you turn Silence Mode on (the switch left), you will feel a vibration as a confirmation. In Silence Mode, all signals are given by vibration instead of sounds. 
There is another setting for sounds and vibrations in the Settings menu (Settings - Vibration and sounds). The settings are meaningful only when the Silence Switch is off (turned right).

USB-C Port
You will find an oval USB-C Port at the far left of the rear edge. Use the cable that came with your BraillePen24 to connect your device to a PC for charging.

micro-SD card slot
There is a microSD card slot Next to the USB-C port. You can record textbooks for reading on the SD card. The accepted formats of the book files are .txt and .brf. The .brf format is the most robust for reading books. See the section about files on microSD card below.

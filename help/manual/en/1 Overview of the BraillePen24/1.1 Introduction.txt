The BraillePen24 is a braille terminal that can be used with virtually any screen reader on the market, including screen readers installed on, or already part of, mobile device operating systems (iOS, Android). The BraillePen24 can also work in application mode, where you can use one of the applications present in the device. The e-mail, calendar, contacts, and notes in the device may be synchronized with your other devices over the Internet, using servers such as Gmail or IMAP. This unique feature allows you to read and answer your e-mail messages, use your notes and other data instantly after turning on the device, and keep them synchronized with data on different devices. 
The Internet connection for synchronization is performed over Bluetooth Low Energy and a smartphone with a data plan; thus, it does not take much power from the phone or BraillePen24.
It can also be used with a tablet without a data plan as long as it is connected to Wi-Fi.

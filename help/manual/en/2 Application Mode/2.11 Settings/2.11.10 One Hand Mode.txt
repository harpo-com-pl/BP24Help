This option enables or disables one-hand mode for users restricted to using a single hand. When you turn on your BraillePen24, you will be notified if one-hand mode is enabled.
When using One-hand mode, the Spacebar must be pressed after most kinds of input are made. For example, to type a braille letter, press the corresponding braille keys either all at once or one at a time, and then press Space. To use a hotkey combination like Space + E to save and exit in the editor, you need to press Space, dot 1, dot 5, and then press Space again.

Only the thumb keys and the joystick are not affected by the need to press Space after information input.
